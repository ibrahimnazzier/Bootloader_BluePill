# Bootloader Project for ARM STM32F103C8 MCU

Welcome to the bootloader project for the ARM STM32F103C8 Microcontroller Unit (MCU). This project aims to provide a robust and efficient bootloader that can handle various tasks essential for the operation and maintenance of the MCU.

## Features

The bootloader supports the following commands:

1. **Get Version**: This command allows you to retrieve the current version of the bootloader.
2. **Help Command**: This command provides a list of all available commands along with a brief description of what each command does.
3. **Get Chip Identification Number**: This command retrieves the unique identification number of the chip. This can be useful for inventory management and device tracking.
4. **Get Read Protection Level**: This command returns the current read protection level of the flash memory. It helps in understanding the security level of the MCU.
5. **Jump to Specific Address**: This command allows the bootloader to jump to a specific address in the memory. This is useful for tasks like executing user applications.
6. **Perform Flash Erase**: This command erases the flash memory. It's an essential step before writing new data or programs to the memory.
7. **Bootloader Write Memory**: This command writes data to a specific location in the memory. It's used for tasks like updating the firmware or user applications.

This project is designed to be a starting point for anyone looking to understand the workings of a bootloader for the ARM STM32F103C8 MCU. It provides a solid foundation that can be built upon to create more complex and feature-rich bootloaders. Enjoy exploring and happy coding! ðŸš€.
